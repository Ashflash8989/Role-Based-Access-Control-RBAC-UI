# Role-Based-Access-Control-RBAC-UI

**Project Overview**
The Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) UI is a web application designed to manage users, roles, and permissions in an organization. It provides administrators with a streamlined interface to assign roles, define permissions, and manage user access rights effectively. The project showcases best practices in UI design, modularity, and centralized state management using React.js and Tailwind CSS.

**Key Features**
1. User Management
Add, edit, and delete users through an intuitive interface.
Assign roles and permissions dynamically to users.
View the list of users with their assigned roles and permissions.

3. Role Management
Define new roles and edit existing ones.
Display users assigned to each role.
Assign or update permissions for each role.

5. Permission Management
Define new permissions and edit existing ones.
Display users and roles linked to each permission.
Assign and manage permissions dynamically.

7. Centralized State Management
RBAC Context: A global state management system implemented using React Context API for users, roles, and permissions.
All components interact with a single centralized store, ensuring data consistency across the application.

9. CRUD Functionality
Mock API simulation for creating, reading, updating, and deleting data for users, roles, and permissions.

11. Responsive Design
Tailwind CSS ensures a fully responsive UI that works seamlessly on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

**Core Technologies**
Frontend Framework: React.js
Styling: Tailwind CSS
State Management: React Context API
Mock API Simulation: Simulated server responses for CRUD operations

**How to Use the Project**
1-Setup
  -Clone the repository.
  -Install dependencies:
        npm install  
-Start the development server:
        npm start  
        
2-Features
-Navigate between User Management, Role Management, and Permission Management.
-Add users, roles, and permissions dynamically.
-Assign roles and permissions to users, and visualize these changes in real time.


**Sample Workflow**

-Create a User
Navigate to the User Management page and create a new user.
The user will be visible in the Role Management and Permission Management sections.

-Assign Roles to a User
Assign a role to the user in the User Management section.
View the updated role in the Role Management section.

-Assign Permissions to a Role
Define or assign permissions to a role in the Role Management section.
These permissions will reflect in the Permission Management section and for the assigned users.

-Delete a User
Deleting a user will remove them from all sections, including their roles and permissions.


**Notable Features**
Default Role Assignment: Every new user is assigned a default "Viewer" role.
Dynamic Updates: Any changes to roles or permissions are reflected instantly across all components.
Reusable Components: Modal and Table components are built to be flexible and reusable.
Error Handling: Ensures users cannot assign invalid roles or permissions.

**Challenges Solved**
Maintaining data consistency across components.
Dynamically linking users, roles, and permissions using centralized context.
Building an intuitive and responsive UI for complex RBAC operations.

**Future Enhancements**
Integrate real backend APIs for persistent data storage.
Implement search, sorting, and filtering options for better usability.
Add advanced role hierarchies and custom permissions.

**Conclusion**
This project demonstrates a complete implementation of a Role-Based Access Control system with an emphasis on UI design, centralized state management, and modularity. It provides a robust foundation for scaling and integrating with a backend for real-world applications.
